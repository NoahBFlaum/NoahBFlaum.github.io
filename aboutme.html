                    <li><hr>Following my final year at Palm Desert High School,
                    I plan to persue a career in the field of comptuer science,
                    however, whilst learning more about the field, I will aquire
                    a job at Eisenhower Medical Center in Palm Desert, California
                    through my previous connection I aquired there when I
                    volunteered for three consecutive summers. I plan
                    to partake in a menial job whilst there so that I may be able
                    to pursuse a furthering of my education at the College of The
                    Desert. And from there, I shall pursue education towards the
                    computer sciences, and applying for work as a web designer
                    for local businesses, and build upon my knowledge with real
                    world experiece and problem solving.

                    <li><hr>I have been working at a fast food resuratnt for the
                    past year and a half, all the while attending high school full
                    time, and seeing how i am still able to maintain an average
                    to high GPA, I would say that my time management skills are
                    quite evident. But work nonwithstanding, I have also been
                    on the Palm Desert High School Tennis Team, and have participated
                    in the two clubs, Young Americans For Freedom and Debate Club,
                    in which I have to maintain a constant and vigorous attentive
                    listening and thinking attitude to be a part of.

                    second place medals in the Palm Valley 16-18 Group Tournament,
                    and scholatically, I have taken and passed the AP Spanish class,

                    for a continuative position for Poetry Out Loud which I
                    unfortunaley had to turn down so that I might not skip my First
                    Lego League tournament in which my team came in first place for
                    the second year in a row.
