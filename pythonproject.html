        <p class="bordered">For this project, our team, consisting of Paula Flores, Noah Flaum, and Eowyn Adair created a sample bank program in which we needed to be able to have an account, and be able to deposit, withdrawl and transfer funds from that account to another. <br>This video displays a quick walkthrough of the banking system, starting with an example of the sign in. Then we go through a quick demonstration of the options of the program, namely the review balance, withdrawl and transfer oprions.</p>

        <p class="bordered">For this project I was responsible for the creation of the basic structure of the program, namely the files and a rough draft of thier projected intentions, as well as integrating the function within a function paramater of the rubric.<br> The biggest difficulty that I ecnountered was the fact that I could not call variables from outside of a function. I had to rewrite a large protion of the code in order for it to be able to not call variables, but be able to take an input and return an output which would then be used to change the variable. <br> Additionally, I had a problem with value errors in which invalid inputs would break the code, and so I input the Spam Protection system in which the code trys every part of it, and should a value error be identified, it would retry the program, and add to a counter that would terminate the program should the number of errors exceed 10.</p>
